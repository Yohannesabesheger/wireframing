# Wireframing and Prototyping: Using Figma
In most cases, as a frontend developer in software development, you will receive a complete set of mockup designs from the UI/UX design team. These designs are usually well thought out, providing you with an idea of what the end product will look like and all the assets you will need for implementing the UI.

There are several wireframing tools available, most of which use the same underlying concepts. Figma is a great tool. Letâ€™s take a moment to understand some wireframing basics.

What is wireframing ?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.
